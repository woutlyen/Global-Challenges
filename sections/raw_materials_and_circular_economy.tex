\section{Raw materials and circular economy}
\subsection{Introduction}	
\subsubsection{What are resources}
	
Our prosperity relies on easy access to abundant raw materials, with global demand exceeding 100 billion tonnes annually and predicted to double by 2060. Raw materials, substances or resources processed for product creation, are sourced from the earth's crust, nature, and recycled waste in the economy or technosphere. \\
\\
Examples of raw materials from the lithosphere or earth crust are fossil oil and gas, iron ore, bauxite as raw material for aluminium, minerals such as sand or marble, lithium brines, and so on. Metals are often found in ores with varying concentrations, and their distribution is uneven globally. Biomass, derived from nature, includes plant-based and animal-derived materials. Secondary raw materials, extracted from recycled waste, vary in extraction rates, e.g., lead at 70\%, while lithium remains below 1\%. Despite recycling efforts, 88 to 94\% of materials in new products still come from primary resources. \\
\\
Raw material sources span the litho-, bio-, and technosphere. The industrial metabolism concept likens the economy's material processes to the human body's metabolism, providing insight into material management, waste, and emissions for sustainable improvements.

\subsubsection{Case: Electric car}

The ongoing effort to combat climate change includes a significant focus on the energy transition, with a key aspect being the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The transition is evident in the rapid increase in EV sales, accounting for 14\% of new car sales in 2022, up from 9\% in 2021 and 5\% in 2020. Figure \ref{fig:electriccarsales} depicts a substantial rise in electric car sales, reaching an estimated 14 million in 2023, with 8 million sold in China.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\label{fig:electriccarsales}
\end{figure}
\ \\
The shift to EVs brings about a change in the materials used, replacing combustion engines with catalysts containing Pt, Pd, and Rh with electric motors requiring copper and neodymium magnets (NdFeB). Power is supplied by Li-ion batteries, raising concerns about the availability of materials to meet the growing demand. Questions arise regarding the duration of lithium availability for Li-ion batteries and the overall environmental impact of EVs compared to traditional combustion engine vehicles. Additionally, considerations about battery recycling and recyclability play a crucial role in evaluating the sustainability of electric vehicles.

\subsection{Material demand}
\subsubsection{trends in material demand}

Over the past five decades, global demand for materials has surged, more than tripling, outpacing both population and GDP growth. While the world's population doubled during this period, the \textbf{gross domestic product} (GDP) quadrupled. The implications of this growth raise questions about the future trajectory of our material needs over the next 10, 20, or 100 years. To forecast this trajectory, an analysis of the driving forces behind the evolution of global material demand is crucial.\\
\\
Three primary factors propel global material demand: population, affluence (which represents the average level of wealth per person, measured by GDP per capita), and technology (material intensity per dollar of GDP). While population growth continues, its significance in driving material demand is diminishing due to declining growth rates. Affluence, reflecting individual wealth, has seen a consistent growth rate when adjusted for inflation and cost of living, leading to a stable projection for the foreseeable future.\\
\\
The most intricate factor, technology, involves examining the material efficiency of the economy. Comparisons between GDP per person and material footprint per person across countries reveal a trend – larger GDP correlates with a larger material footprint, but the relationship is not strictly linear. This observation holds true over the years, suggesting a pattern in global evolution.\\
\\
In industrialized nations, a notable trend emerges – a relative decoupling of economic growth and material demand growth. While the absolute material footprint increases, the relative footprint per dollar of GDP decreases. This pattern contrasts with countries undergoing industrialization, such as China in the past 30 years, where material demand grew faster than GDP due to intense infrastructure development.\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../images/material_demand_growth_rates}
	\caption{Material demand growth rates throughout the past 50 years}
	\label{fig:materialdemandgrowthrates}
\end{figure}
\ \\
Looking ahead, the future trajectory involves anticipating the dynamics of these three factors. Population growth will continue but at a slower pace. Affluence will persist in its growth to ensure equal opportunities globally. The technology factor, representing material intensity, is expected to vary across countries. China, a significant purchaser of materials, is forecasted to enter a less material-intensive phase, while countries like India and many African nations may undergo material-intensive development phases.\\
\\\\
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) foresees a doubling of worldwide material demand by 2060, indicating further growth. However, this growth will not be uniform across all material types. Materials crucial for the energy transition, such as lithium, are expected to experience much higher growth rates. For instance, demand for lithium in 2050 is projected to be 20 times higher than today, emphasizing the changing landscape of material needs in the context of evolving technologies and global priorities.

\subsubsection{Case: Electric car}

The shift towards electrical mobility requires a lot of materials that where not very much used before, such as Lithium, and an substantial increase in demand of some commodities, such as Nickel or Copper. Figure \ref{fig:Lithium} and \ref{fig:Nickel} underneath show the forecasted demand for the coming decades of lithium and nickel, in the case of the STEPS and SDS IEA scenarios.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\ \\
Two scenarios as put forward by the International Energy Agency are considered in these figures:\\
\\
\textbf{The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) }reflects current policy settings based on a sector-by-sector assessment of the specific policies that are in place, as well as those that have been announced by governments around the world. It provides an indication of where today’s policy measures and plans lead the energy sector.\\
\\
\textbf{The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) }charts a pathway that meets in full the world’s goals to tackle climate change in line with the Paris Agreement while meeting universal energy access and significantly reducing air pollution. In this scenario, all current net zero pledges are achieved in full and there are extensive efforts to realize near-term emissions reductions; advanced economies reach net zero emissions by 2050, China around 2060, and all other countries by 2070 at the latest.

\subsection{Material scarcity}
\subsubsection{Causes of scarcity}

The availability of materials is a nuanced issue that involves various dimensions of scarcity. Examining the abundance of chemical elements in the Earth's crust reveals disparities, with some elements being plentiful, such as silicon and aluminium, while others, like gold, are rare but economically interesting to mine due to the concentration in ores.\\
\\
Absolute scarcity, often associated with the idea of running out of resources, is challenging to predict due to ongoing exploration and technological advancements enabling the extraction of materials from less concentrated ores. However, significant challenges exist in terms of depleting easily accessible and high-quality raw materials, with quality meaning the concentration of useful elements the raw materials contain. For instance, copper ore quality has decreased over time from 3\% to 0,3\%, necessitating larger amounts to be mined for the same output.\\
\\
Another dimension of scarcity involves the geopolitical and economic concentration of certain ores in specific countries. This concentration, as seen with lithium in Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina, cobalt in Central and South Africa, and rare earth metals in China, can lead to global supply chain vulnerabilities, especially when geopolitical tensions arise.\\
\\
Additionally, some high-tech elements, like indium which is found in zinc, are structurally scarce as they are by-products of ores containing more abundant metals. This linkage can create challenges in meeting demand, as increasing production of the desired element may flood the market with the carrier metal, affecting its price. Therefore, we say that indium is structurally scarce.\\
\\
In conclusion, while absolute scarcity is not imminent for most elements, the uneven distribution of ores, geopolitical and economic dependencies, and structural scarcity of certain elements pose significant challenges. Mitigating these challenges involves reducing dependence on raw materials, exploring alternative sources, and promoting sustainable practices to ensure a more resilient global economy.

\subsubsection{Case: Absolute scarcity}
\paragraph{Static and dynamic depletion index}
\ \\
Absolute scarcity describes the physical depletion of non-renewable resources. There is a certain amount available for extraction in reserves, but this amount will run out over time. When we want to predict how much time we have before a certain resource runs out, we look at the available reserve (R) and the yearly production or use of that resource (P).\\
\\
If we divide the current reserve by the current demand, so R/P, we see how many years are still left. This is called the static depletion index \textbf{static depletion index}. \\
\\
However, demand for raw materials changes, for most materials it increases. When we take the predicted change in demand into account, we call this the \textbf{dynamic depletion index}. For a resource with an increase in demand, the dynamic index will be smaller than the static index

\paragraph{Depletion of copper}
\ \\
The static and dynamic depletion indices for copper defy expectations, showing a relatively stable pattern over time instead of a continual decrease as assumed, as shown in figure \ref{fig:staticdynamicindexcopper}. This stability is attributed to the discovery of new reserves and advancements in extraction technology, prolonging the availability of copper. However, this prolonged use has consequences: the easily accessible copper ore has been depleted, leading to a decline in ore quality from 2-5\% copper at the beginning of the last century to 0.3\% today.
\newpage

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../images/static_dynamic_index_copper}
	\caption{Static and dynamic index of Copper}
	\label{fig:staticdynamicindexcopper}
\end{figure}
\ \\
As a result:
\begin{itemize} 
	\item The need to mine ten times as much copper ore per kg of copper has increased.
	\item More energy is required to produce one kg of copper despite improved extraction technologies.
	\item The environmental impact is higher.
	\item The price of copper has risen, influenced by increased production costs and stricter environmental regulations.
\end{itemize}
\ \\
While predictions may initially suggest a resource is running out, the reality is an extended timeline with escalating costs and environmental impact.

\subsubsection{Case: Structural scarcity}

Materials that are structurally scarce, such as Germanium and Gallium, are primarily obtained as byproducts during the extraction of other materials.\\
\\
\textbf{Germanium}: It is derived mainly from sphalerite, found in ores of silver, lead, and copper. Another source is fly ash from coal-fueled power plants containing germanium. Germanium is utilized in optics (e.g., camera lenses, optical fibers, infrared cameras) and electronics (high-speed chips, solar panels).\\
\\
\textbf{Gallium}: Produced exclusively as a byproduct during the processing of other metal ores, with bauxite (chief ore of aluminum) and sulfidic zinc ores being primary sources. Gallium is employed in semiconductors (high-speed computer chips), photovoltaic cells, laser diodes, cable television transmission, commercial wireless infrastructure, and satellites.\\
\\
In addition to being structurally scarce, there can also be geopolitical scarcity. For instance, a significant portion of production occurs in China, which, in July 2023, announced export restrictions on specific gallium and germanium products. Fortunately, alternative sources for these minerals exist outside of China.
\newpage
\subsubsection{Case: Economic and geopolitical scarcity}

Price and availability of resources is also influenced by economics – supply and demand –and the geopolitical presence of the reserves. This is illustrated for example by cobalt. Cobalt is used in lithium batteries, which are used in electric vehicles. The main cobalt reserves are located in the east of Congo, a region which is politically unstable. \\
\\
Due to the climate crisis, there have been a lot of investments in electric vehicles, leading to a strong increase in cobalt demand. Because cobalt comes from an unstable region, battery producers will store larger amounts of cobalt to deal with uncertainties in supply. Which in turn led to an even stronger increase in cobalt demand. This caused a very strong increase in cobalt prices in 2018, as you can see in figure \ref{fig:cobaltprices}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../images/cobalt_prices}
	\caption{Cobalt prices for the last 10 years}
	\label{fig:cobaltprices}
\end{figure}

\ \\
As a response, on the one hand big mining companies increased their capacity, but on the other hand the artisanal cobalt mining increased, where local people start mining cobalt by themselves. This is however a dangerous and unhealthy practice and can also stimulate child labour. \\
\\
At the same time there were technological improvements to batteries, where they needed almost no cobalt anymore. The increase in supply and smaller increase in demand in turn caused the prices of cobalt to drop again. 
\newpage

\subsubsection{Case: Electric car}

The demand for some metals will increase drastically because of the rapid introduction of electrical vehicles. The question is whether we will not run out of these metals.\\
\\
Nickel as example, needed for the batteries of electrical vehicles, does not suffer from an absolute, nor from a structural scarcity. Yet, the forecasted supply in the coming years is not sufficient to meet the increasing demand when an SDS scenario is pursued. Other actions will be necessary.\\
\\
We also observe a shift in supply towards South-East Asia, potentially strengthening the economic scarcity.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../images/Global_nickel_supply-demand}
	\caption{Global Nickel supply-demand results}
	\label{fig:globalnickelsupply-demand}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Biobased resources}

The scarcity of raw materials is a pressing concern, prompting exploration of solutions, with a significant focus on biobased materials derived mainly from biomass, including trees and cultivated plants. Currently, around one eighth of materials for products are biobased, with 80\% being wood used in construction, furniture, and paper. Innovations in biobased raw materials, especially for replacing fossil-based plastics, are underway. Historically, humans extensively used bio-based materials for tools and clothing until the industrial revolution and the advent of synthetic polymers.\\
\\
Today, there is a growing interest in biobased materials, particularly for plastics. While some are biodegradable, more than half of new biobased plastics are made from "drop-in polymers," mirroring the properties of their fossil-based counterparts. The advantage of biobased raw materials lies in their renewability, provided they are sourced sustainably, considering their regeneration capacity.\\
\\
However, using biobased resources raises several concerns. The cultivation of biomass requires land, leading to potential competition between land use for materials and food production. Intensive land use can deplete soil, impacting biodiversity. Agriculture-related issues like fertilizer and pesticide use contribute to the environmental impact of biobased materials. Water and energy requirements are additional considerations, with some crops needing substantial amounts.\\
\\
The type of biomass source used for biobased materials is evolving. First-generation biomass sources, derived from food crops, raise concerns about competition with food production. Second-generation sources use by-products and waste to avoid this competition. Third-generation sources, extracted from microorganisms like algae, yeasts, and mycelium, eliminate the need for soil.\\
\\
In conclusion, the transition to biobased materials holds promise for replacing non-renewable resources, but a comprehensive investigation into the entire life cycle is necessary to assess and mitigate potential environmental impacts.

\subsection{Waste}
\subsubsection{Waste generation}

The world annually produces over 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste, estimated at 2.24 billion tonnes in 2020. To visualize this, it's equivalent to around 7 thousand times the Empire State Building or approximately 300 million elephants. However, waste generation is not uniform globally, varying significantly based on income levels. High-income countries, comprising 16\% of the global population, generate over 30\% of the world's waste, while low-income countries, with 9\% of the global population, contribute only 5\%.\\
\\
Experts predict a substantial increase in global waste production by 2050, reaching an estimated 3.88 billion tonnes, a 73\% increase compared to 2020. The impact on low-income countries is particularly alarming, with waste generation projected to increase over threefold.\\
\\
Municipal solid waste includes household, commercial, and institutional waste, with composition varying worldwide. Low-income countries have higher shares of organic waste, while high-income countries have more recyclable materials like paper, plastic, metal, and glass.\\
\\
Two significant global waste streams are electronic waste (e-waste) and plastic waste. E-waste, consisting of discarded electronics like computers and mobile phones, poses environmental and health risks due to toxic substances. It also contains valuable resources like gold and copper. Annually, 54 million tonnes of e-waste are produced, and it is one of the fastest-growing waste streams.\\
\\
Plastic waste accounted for 12\% of global municipal solid waste in 2016. Mismanagement of plastic waste leads to environmental pollution, with 1.5\% to 4\% ending up in oceans. Approximately 80\% of ocean waste comprises plastics, contributing to severe consequences for the environment and human life. The Basel Convention addresses these issues, ensuring the sound environmental management of e-waste and extending its reach to address plastic waste.\\
\\
Apart from municipal solid waste, industrial waste is generated globally. Industrial waste, originating from industrial activities, is almost 18 times the amount of municipal solid waste. While generation rates vary, industrial waste composition is more homogeneous, allowing better sorting and treatment.\\
\\
Considering the vast amounts of waste generated globally, waste minimization and effective management are crucial for achieving more sustainable development.

\subsubsection{Waste management}

The current trends in waste generation and management have profound environmental, social, and economic impacts. Out of the more than 2 billion tons of waste produced globally, over 30\% is not managed in an environmentally safe manner. The available data indicates that less than 20\% of waste is recycled globally, with approximately 11\% being incinerated, while the majority is still sent to landfills or open dumps.\\
\\
Waste management practices vary widely across countries and income levels. Higher-income countries, despite producing more waste, have more advanced waste treatment facilities and achieve an average recycling rate of 29\%. Conversely, low-income countries heavily rely on open dumping, with 93\% of waste being dumped or burned without proper management. This improper waste management results in resource loss and various environmental and health impacts, including soil and water contamination and air pollution.\\
\\
Several negative impacts of improper waste management are evident. Solid waste contributes to 3\% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and if no improvements are made, it's estimated that solid waste emissions will reach 2.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050. The emission levels depend on waste composition and treatment methods, with the degradation of organic waste in landfills producing carbon dioxide and methane.\\
\\
Uncontrolled burning of waste releases hazardous emissions and particulate matter into the air, causing significant health issues. Unmanaged waste degradation can lead to the creation and runoff of leachate, a hazardous liquid that contaminates water bodies and soil, posing risks to drinking water and disease transmission. Waste degradation times vary, with products like diapers and plastic bags taking 500 to 1000 years to break down.\\
\\
Proper solid waste management is a complex challenge, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It depends on available technologies, income levels, waste composition, and locally appropriate solutions. The cost of treating and cleaning all generated waste is estimated to be over 200 billion euros per year, requiring significant investments and institutional, political, and legislative frameworks.\\
\\
Given the current and projected waste generation and its environmental and health effects, it's crucial to define more sustainable waste management systems. Strategies include waste reduction, improved waste collection, reuse of products, recycling, organic waste management, and capturing greenhouse gases. In Europe, the European Commission has defined the waste hierarchy as a guiding principle for sustainable waste management, prioritizing waste prevention, reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and landfilling as the least preferable alternative, as you can see in figure \ref{fig:wastehierarchy}. Solid waste management is essential to mitigate negative environmental and health effects and transition to a clean and circular economy by promoting resource recovery.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../images/waste_hierarchy}
	\caption{European waste hierarchy}
	\label{fig:wastehierarchy}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Case: Electric car}

In a lot of countries the take back of cars is well regulated, e.g. by an extended producers responsibility scheme. That makes it possible to recycle many materials. In Belgium 93\% of the discarded cars in 2020 were either reused or recycled . \\
\\
However, the discarded cars today mostly have a combustion engine. \textbf{Recycling of electrical cars will demand other recycling technologies}, especially to recover the materials from the batteries. While it is perfectly possible to recycle e.g. the nickel out of the batteries, \textbf{recycling of lithium still is at its infancy} and near to zero. Technologies to also recycle lithium are being developed and it can be expected that a high percentage of the lithium can be recycled as well. This would reduce the demand for virgin lithium. However, a large amount of discarded electrical cars to be recycled can only be expected within 10-20 years.

\newpage
\subsection{Impact throughout material lifecycle}
\subsubsection{Overview of impacts}

The Global Resources Outlook published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 2019 analyzed the impact of natural resource use on the environment and human health. The focus of the discussion is on the colored bars in figure \ref{fig:materialimpact}, representing \textbf{the share of the global impact of different resource types} (biomass, metals, non-metallic minerals, and fossil fuels) \textbf{on four categories}: climate change, particulate matter health, water stress, and land-use related biodiversity loss.\\
\\
When considering the impact of all resource types together, they collectively contribute to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{More than 50\% of total global greenhouse gas emissions} (excluding climate impacts related to land use). All types of resources significantly contribute to overall impacts.
	\item \textbf{More than 90\% of biodiversity loss and water stress}. Agriculture, especially household food consumption, is the primary driver of these impacts.
\end{enumerate}
\ \\
Figure \ref{fig:materialimpact} breaks down the impact of each resource type on different categories.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../images/Material_impact}
	\caption{Global impacts split by recourse type, remaining economy and households}
	\label{fig:materialimpact}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\ \\
\textbf{Biomass:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Responsible for almost \textbf{90\% of global water stress}.
	\item Contributes to almost \textbf{90\% of land-use related biodiversity loss}, involving habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and loss of ecosystem services.
	\item Accounts for more than \textbf{30\% of resource-related greenhouse gas emissions} (excluding land use change).
\end{itemize}
\ \\
\textbf{Metals:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Between 2000 and 2015, climate change and health impacts from metal extraction and production approximately doubled.
	\item \textbf{Climate change }impact is primarily \textbf{due to iron and steel production} (a quarter of global industrial energy demand) and energy-intensive \textbf{aluminium production}.
	\item \textbf{Toxicity} impacts are a major concern for copper and precious metals.
\end{itemize}
\ \\
\textbf{Non-metallic minerals:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Makes up more than 45\% of the total mass of extracted resources. However, its impact remains limited.
	\item The \textbf{production of clinker}, the main ingredient in cement, is a significant contributor to impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions because of the enormous volumes of concrete and cement.
	\item \textbf{Mining} for sand can have \textbf{critical impacts on local ecosystems}.
\end{itemize}
\ \\
\textbf{Fossil fuels:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Coal, oil and natural gas provide energy and raw materials for various products like pharmaceuticals, plastics, and paints.
	\item Contributes significantly to \textbf{environmental pollution, especially air pollution}, throughout extraction, processing, distribution, and use.
	\item Over the recent years, there has been a more than \textbf{70\% increase in capacity for global fossil fuel electricity generation}, leading to increased access to affordable energy but with environmental and health trade-offs.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Greenhouse gas emissions}

As we just saw, \textbf{more than half of all greenhouse gas emissions are related to materials management activities.} If we look at material production only, we see a rise in emission from 5  GtCO2eq in 1995 to 11.5 Gt CO2eq in 2019. These emissions are projected to rise to approximately 50 Gt CO2eq by 2060. \\
\\
The largest contribution (left side of figure \ref{fig:ghgemissions}) comes from bulk materials production, such as iron and steel, cement, lime and plaster, other minerals mostly used as construction products, as well as plastics and rubber. Two thirds of the materials are used (right side of figure \ref{fig:ghgemissions}) to make capital goods, with buildings and vehicles among the most important. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../images/GHG_emissions}
	\caption{GHG emissions}
	\label{fig:ghgemissions}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Comparing countries}
\ \\
The production of materials consumed in industrialized countries has been largely behind growth in developing and emerging economies from 1995-2015. This is due to the outsourcing of heavy industry to developing countries. \\
\\
The impact of countries can be compared from both \textbf{production and consumption perspectives} (all the material produced in a country $\leftrightarrow$ all the materials produced for all the goods used in a country). \\
\\
Because a lot of the heavy industry has been moved to developing countries, we usually see that for developed countries the impact from a consumption perspective is (much) higher than the production perspective, while for developing countries this is the opposite. 

\paragraph{Cement and steel}
\ \\
Cement and steel are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce these emissions, there are several solutions. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item One is to \textbf{decrease production energy} through more efficient processes and use more renewable energy sources. 
	\item Another solution is to \textbf{use different resources} during production processes, such as hydrogen instead of cokes in steel production. Another solution is to capture CO2 emissions before it is released into the atmosphere and store it, or use it elsewhere. 
	\item \textbf{Reusing and recycling waste} can also help decrease the demand for new materials.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Biobased polymers}
\ \\
Biobased polymers capture some CO2 but emit CO2 during production, \textbf{depending on the resource used}. For example PLA made from maize has a much larger greenhouse gas emission than PLA made from sugar cane. These emissions can be comparable or even larger than petroleum-based polymers. So while biobased polymers have the potential for a lower impact, the \textbf{impact of the entire production process has to be evaluated} to ensure this.\\
\\
Waste treatment also contributes to emissions, but these are decreasing due to better recycling technology.

\subsubsection{Measuring impact}

The concept of environmental impact is a central theme in this course, prompting an exploration of its definition, categorization, and systematic quantification. This discussion aims to compare alternative solutions by bringing their impacts to a single scale for effective design and engineering purposes.\\
\\
When engaging with people in society about what impact is relevant to them, different categories emerge. Three primary concerns are identified:\\
\\
\textbf{Human Health:} Measured using Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY’s), which considers not only the fact of being alive but also the quality of life, incorporating diseases into the parameter.\\
\\
\textbf{Biodiversity:} Assessed through the Potentially Disappeared Fraction of species (PDF) per surface unit per time period per year, reflecting concerns about the health and disappearance of flora and fauna.\\
\\
\textbf{Resource Depletion:} Evaluated by looking into the cost of replacing materials, considering the difficulty in replacing lost materials, especially when mining becomes more challenging and concentrations decrease.\\
\\
These endpoint indicators—Human Health, Biodiversity, and Resource Depletion—are indirectly affected through physical and chemical phenomena known as impact categories. Climate change is cited as an example, where various emissions, such as CO2 and methane, contribute. The need to account for the potency of different substances, like methane having a much greater impact than CO2, leads to the concept of CO2 equivalents. In the case of methane, for example, that's about 23 times more powerful in affecting the climate change effects.\\
\\
The systematic quantification involves quantifying inputs and outputs from systems, products, and processes. This information is then converted into impact effects through mid-point categories. The final challenge is connecting these mid-point indicators to the endpoint concerns of human health, biodiversity, and material depletion.\\
\\
Fortunately, a well-established methodology referred to as Life Cycle Assessment, and accompanying software tools are available to facilitate this process, offering a comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing environmental impact concerns.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.78\linewidth]{../images/Visualisation_for_measuring_impact}
	\caption{Visualisation on how to measure impact}
	\label{fig:visualisationformeasuringimpact}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Life Cycle Analysis}

The systematic comparison of alternative design concepts or system designs, particularly concerning environmental impact and impact avoidance, is facilitated by the established field of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA is a well-studied and standardized methodology, with ISO 14040 series providing a solid foundation. Following the procedures outlined in these standards is crucial for conducting LCA studies effectively.\\
\\
The four main blocks of an LCA study are:\\
\\
\textbf{Goal and Scope Definition:} Clearly define what is included and excluded from the study to avoid confusion. Determine the system boundaries and decide on the scope, whether it's a product or a functionality.\\
\\
\textbf{Inventory:} Collect relevant data on inputs and outputs. This phase can be time-consuming but is indispensable for accurate analysis.\\
\\
\textbf{Impact Assessment:} Assess how different inputs and outputs contribute to various impact categories discussed earlier (e.g., human health, biodiversity, resource depletion).\\
\\
\textbf{Interpretation:} Use the results for product development, strategic planning, policy-making, or marketing. External verification may be required for certain applications.\\
\\
The challenge lies in determining system boundaries, such as what is included or excluded, and defining the functional unit. For example, when comparing cars, should one consider a two-seater equivalent to a van in functionality or based on a certain number of drives?\\
\\
The inventory stage involves tracking processes, materials, products, and their inputs and outputs. This includes energy, consumables, waste streams, and emissions. Allocation of impact to the product and by-products is essential.\\
\\
Once impacts are identified, normalization is employed to bring them to the same scale for comparison. However, determining what is "normal" or the reference point can be subjective. Weight factors based on different clusters of opinions can be used, but this introduces subjectivity.\\
\\
The ISO 14040 series recommends acknowledging the subjectivity in combining end-point categories (human health, biodiversity, and resource depletion) and suggests it as an optional exercise. Emphasizing the importance of underlying data is crucial, as it forms the basis for the scientific rigor of the study.
\newpage
\subsubsection{Case: Electric car}

There is a lot of discussion whether or not electrical vehicles (EVs) are more environmentally friendly than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). The conclusion will largely depend on the system boundaries, and the impacts you consider.

The goal of the shift to electrical vehicles is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It can be said that indeed this is the case, even including the production of the cars and batteries. It will depend on the source of the electricity (see figure \ref{fig:lcaemissionselectriccars}). Evidently, the benefit becomes more evident when the consumed energy has a low CO2 footprint as in Sweden or France.

\ \\
On the other hand, we have to be aware that the production of batteries contributes significantly to other environmental impacts such as human toxicity and ecotoxicity, making the impact for these categories larger for EVs than ICEVs according to the state-of-the-art.
